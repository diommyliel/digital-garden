*This part explore different misconceptions on people management, and notably argues why the 'Human ressource' cannot be thought as similar to any other type of resources (especially noting its 'nonmodular' nature), and the root cause of why a number of managing people does not take this into account* 


## Chap 1 : Somewhere, today, a project is failing

This chapter explore why an overwhelming majority of project failure are caused by human factors. 

The authors have conducted, for that matter, annual surveys for a number of projects and recorded and number of indicators. For the 15% of projects observed that failed to completed (up to 25 % percent for said 'bigger' projects), they contacted people remaining from these efforts to try to understand the reasons behind this. And for the vast majority of them, the issues were not technical in the least

#### the name of the game

The authors find that, for the majority of failures that were reported to them, the cause of failure was 'sociological' and not technical

They also argue that while managers tend to agree that they got 'human' problems, they usually do not  treat them, but tend to treat 'technical' issues more. This is coming from the fact that a lot of managers come from a technical background, but also from the fact that managers have seldom been taught how to manage, nor been promoted because they showed managerial capacities in the least.


#### the high tech illusion

The authors find that one reason for the attention given to technology is the viewed 'high-tech' nature of the programming industry, and the pride that comes with it.

This is just an illusion though, as only the ones doing research on breakthrough subjects really working in High-tech, while most of us in this industry are only applying their results 
//note: might I add, badly a lot of the time//

Thus, according to them, focusing on technology rather than sociology as a manager is ridiculous
